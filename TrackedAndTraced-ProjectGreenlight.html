    <h2><b>Tracked And Traced: Does Project Greenlight in Detroit Reduce Crime?</b></h1>
    <h3><i>Febuary 3rd, 2022</i></h3>
    <p>In order to participate in Project Green Light, businesses must pay for the installation of required cameras, signs and additional lighting, a cost of around $5,000. On top of that initial investment, businesses have to pay for high-powered Wi-Fi to transmit video. Manager Ismail Salah says the expense has been worth it for his station. He says he’s gotten good feedback from his customers since joining the program about five years ago.
    <br>Before at night they’d be afraid but now they’re happy,</q> Salah says.
    <br>Indeed, almost every customer I talk to here is a fan of the program. David Hunter says he likes that the place is monitored 24/7. <q>I feel really comfortable when I come to this gas station. It’s my favorite one,</q> says Hunter.
    <br>Customer Keshia Johnson says she feels more at ease patronizing Green Light stations. <q>So, I always come here because I make sure I’m safe,</q> she says.
    <br>Salah says thefts and other crimes still happen but he feels like incidents have decreased since the business joined Green Light. And when crimes do happen, he says, the police come right away.</p>
